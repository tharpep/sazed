-- The shared run row (My-AI plans/14, contract 1): one shape for every run, whatever engine ran
-- it, so the board, bake-offs and learning read one place. A view for now; a table only once the
-- graph engine needs to write rows of its own. 013-016 are claimed by open work, hence 017.

-- variant: which arm of a bake-off a job was. failure_class: what kind of failure it was, for
-- the learning ledger (filled later). Both stay NULL for ordinary jobs.
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS variant TEXT;
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS failure_class TEXT;

-- One state vocabulary: queued, needs_approval, running, needs_input, paused, succeeded,
-- skipped, failed, cancelled, timed_out (graph tasks will add blocked, landed, conflict).
-- Jobs already use it. Plan 12 step statuses map onto it: ok and approved are succeeded, error
-- is failed, a gate's stop is skipped, a pause waiting on Pryce is needs_approval.
