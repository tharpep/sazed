- **architecture-overview.md** — High-level diagram: client, agent, gateway, and data store. Use for quick orientation.
- **architecture-detailed.md** — Detailed diagram: entry, routers, agent loop, tools, memory, session processing, and database tables. Use for implementation and onboarding.

Render the `mermaid` code blocks in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (e.g. GitHub, VS Code with extension, or [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live)).
